# clipper-archive

Archive of old clipper version needed by conan+assimp but removed from SourceForge after Clipper2 was created

Assiump 5.1.x and later uses Clipper 4.10.0, whose conan recipe tries to download it from 
[sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/polyclipping/files/Older%20versions/) where it
no longer exists.

I've reached out to the forum/author to try to get them restored. 
That did happen in August 2022, but today (2023-09-07) it broke again since SourceForge went into "temporary static offline mode".

Best keep these zip's around as long as assimp needs them, or get them onto conan center index somehow.
