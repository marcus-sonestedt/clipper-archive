# clipper-archive

Archive of old clipper version needed by conan+assimp but removed from SourceForge after Clipper2 was created

Assiump 5.1.x and later uses Clipper 4.10.0, whose conan recipe tries to download it from 
[sorceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/polyclipping/files/Older%20versions/clipper_ver4.10.0.zip) where it
no longer exists.

I've reached out to the forum/author to try to get them restored, but not sure if that will happen.
